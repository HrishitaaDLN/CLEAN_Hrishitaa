       # 7. Define the analysis prompt
    prompt = """ You are tasked with analyzing a city's Climate Action Plan (CAP) or related report. Based on the content, assess whether it addresses key areas across political commitment, governance, stakeholder engagement, emissions data, risk assessments, strategies, equity, and monitoring.
        Please respond using Yes/No and provide brief justifications or references where applicable. Where methods, tools, or stakeholder names are mentioned, list or summarize them clearly. Provide a comprehensive analysis along with scores. A "Yes" must be given a score of 1 and a "No" must be given a score of 0.
        ðŸ”¹ 1. First Steps
        Has the city explicitly secured high-level political commitment to climate action or sustainability, endorsing a standard such as the Paris Agreement and defining ambitious goals?
        Has the city explicitly established and publicly communicated a clear, long-term vision for its low-carbon, climate-resilient, or sustainable future?
        ðŸ”¹ 2. Governance
        Has the city explicitly established clear cross-departmental governance structures or legally binding frameworks to ensure accountability and coordination for CAP implementation or a similar effort?
        ðŸ”¹ 3. Stakeholder & Community Engagement
            3.1 Identifying Priority Stakeholders:
        Does the report identify groups most impacted by climate change or sustainability issues (e.g., children, women, disabled, marginalized, frontline communities)?
        Are groups mentioned above excluded from previous engagement processes acknowledged?
        3.2 Engagement & Collaboration:
        Does the report mention planned engagement with the private sector, national/regional governments, or other stakeholders?
        Has the city identified influential actors supportive of its climate or sustainability plans?
            3.3 Engagement Methods:
        Have key stakeholders been integrated through long-term engagement throughout planning and implementation? If yes, which methods and groups?
        Has the broader public been engaged via surveys, consultations, summits, etc.?
        ðŸ”¹ 4. GHG Emissions Inventory
        Is the city measuring GHG emissions? If yes, what methodology is used?
        Does it use a specific tool for inventory management and reporting?
        Are the emissions inventory calculations publicly published?
        ðŸ”¹ 5. Sustainability Risk Assessment
        A sustainability risk assessment seeks to understand the likelihood of current and future sustainability hazards and the potential impacts of these hazards on cities and their inhabitants.A special case is a Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA). A climate hazard assessment identifies probability, intensity, and timescale. A climate impact assessment identifies impacts on people, infrastructure, and services.
        Has the city conducted a climate or sustainability hazard assessment (probability, intensity, timescale)?
        Has the city conducted a climate or sustainability impact assessment (on people, infrastructure, services)?
        Has the city conducted a full CCRA or related assessment?
        Has the CCRA or related assessment been outsourced? If so, to whom?
        Has the CCRA or related assessment been updated or scheduled for renewal?
        Has the CCRA or related assessment included interdependent risks and adaptive capacity analysis?
        Has the CCRA or related assessment been made public?
        ðŸ”¹ 6. City Needs Assessment
        Has the city analyzed socioeconomic context, environmental quality, and alignment with SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) through strategic appraisal?
        Has it assessed city-wide priorities that climate or sustainability actions could address?
        ðŸ”¹ 7. Strategy Identification Mitigation Strategies:
            7.1 Mitigation Strategies
        Has the city defined a planning horizon for its climate or related scenarios?
        A BAU scenario is an emissions projection assuming no additional actions are implemented beyond current policies. Has a Business-As-Usual (BAU) forecast been included?
        Are modeling tools used for scenario development?
        Are mitigation projections based on current plans available?
        Is there an ambitious, long-term mitigation scenario?
        7.2 Adaptation Strategies:
        Has the city identified the root causes of climate or sustainability risks?
        Reactive adaptation fights the immediate negative consequences of climate or sustainability-related hazards, protecting quality of life and the city's systems during climate or sustainability-related disasters and restoring them afterwards. Are any reactive adaptation plans addressed? 
        Preventative adaptation reduces the negative consequences of climate or sustainability-related hazards, aiming to protect quality of life and city systems to avoid those hazard events becoming disasters. Are any preventive adaptation plans included? 
        Transformative adaptation tackles the root causes of climate or sustainability risks, making climate or sustainability-related hazards less likely or severe through fundamental changes to the city's fabric and systems. Are any transformative adaptation plans included? 
        ðŸ”¹ 8. Action Prioritization & Detailing
        Has a longlist of potential actions been developed from an evidence base?
        Has a shortlist of high-priority actions been defined using specific criteria/tools (e.g., ASAP, AMIA, cost-benefit)?
        Does the plan assess the fit of actions within broader city agendas?
        Is there evidence of inclusive stakeholder engagement in prioritization?
        Has the city adopted a flexible, iterative planning process?
        ðŸ”¹ 9. Equity & Inclusivity
            9.1 Stakeholder Inclusion:
        Has the city included a diverse set of stakeholders in planning?
        9.2 Needs & Vulnerability Assessment
        Has the city identified vulnerable groups and reasons for vulnerability?
        Has a comprehensive needs assessment been done?
        9.3 Distributed Impact Analysis:
        Are equity impacts and challenges of actions analyzed?
        Has the city used needs/stakeholder findings to guide climate or sustainability-related actions?
        9.4 Monitoring Equity
        Is a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (MER) system used to track equity outcomes?
        ðŸ”¹ 10. Monitoring, Evaluation & Reporting (MER) 
        Indicators are measurable variables used to evaluate progress or success, defined at three levels: Outputs (direct products), Outcomes (immediate changes resulting from actions), and Impacts (long-term effects contributing toward broader goals).
        10.1 Integration with City Systems:
        Are existing climate or sustainability plans and tracking mechanisms referenced?
        Are inclusivity, public reporting, and data systems discussed?
        10.2 Governance & Stakeholders:
        Are key stakeholders identified in MER? If yes, which ones? 
        10.3 Defining Indicators:
        Are clear indicators set for each action (output, outcome, impact)?
        Are GHG, risk, and co-benefits included?
        10.4: Data Collection
        Has the city identified data sources, ownership, collection methods, and reporting responsibilities?
        10.5: Updating
        Does the city explicitly commit to periodic evaluations of actions from CAP or related efforts against clearly defined baselines and targets?
